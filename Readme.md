# Python test example
At the heart of any functional test automation project is the “core” test framework. The framework handles test case structure, test execution, and pass/fail result reporting. It is the foundation upon which extra packages and code (like Selenium WebDriver) can be added.

pytest is one of Python’s best test frameworks. It is simple, scalable, and Pythonic. Test cases are written as functions, not classes. Test assertion failures are reported with actual values. Plugins can add code coverage, pretty reports, and parallel execution. pytest can integrate with other frameworks like Django and Flask, too. According to the Python Developers Survey 2018, it is also the most popular Python test framework.
